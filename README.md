Pantry is a utility library that provides custom data types to work with various types of values. The `Fractional` data type can be used to represent and perform operations on fractions, while the `Measure` data type can be used to work with measurements and quantities, and the `Money` and `Currency` data types can be used to handle sums of money and currency conversions. This library could be useful in a variety of applications where these types of values need to be handled and manipulated.
